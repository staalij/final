# AP Computer Science Principles Final

## Proposal

### Target Audience
    ---> Anyone with something to count down to.

### Problem you will solve
    ---> My site will be able to count down to an event in a number of interchangable formats. This will be useful in a number of situations, such as cooking, events and anything else where a timer might come in handy.

### Why it needs to be solved
    ---> Nobody wants to count down in their head for more than 2 minutes.
